Based on your comprehensive project description and documentation prioritization best practices[1], here's a strategic prioritization for Minist√©rio do Bloco:

## **Phase 1: Foundation (Start Here - Week 1-2)**

**PRD (Product Requirements)** - Your carnival platform needs crystal-clear feature definitions, especially for complex features like real-time location sharing and multi-language support[1]

**Tech Stack** - Critical for your mobile-first, SEO-focused platform with multiple integrations (Google Calendar, OpenStreetMap, social media embeds)[4]

**Schema Design** - Essential foundation for blocos, events, users, social connections, and real-time location data structures

**Architecture Overview** - Vital for understanding how real-time features, chat, location sharing, and external integrations interact

## **Phase 2: Development Enablement (Week 2-3)**

**Project Structure** - Organize mobile-first responsive design, multi-language files, and complex feature modules

**API Documentation** - Document endpoints for blocos, events, user profiles, social features, and location sharing early[2]

**AI Guidance File (.cursorrules)** - Extremely valuable for maintaining consistency across your complex feature set and integrations[4]

**Backend Architecture Design** - Critical for handling real-time location data, chat, notifications, and social connections

## **Phase 3: User Experience & Quality (Week 3-4)**

**User Flow** - Map carnival discovery journeys, bloco following, event saving, and social connection workflows

**Styling Guide** - Define your Shadcn green theme, mobile-first components, and responsive design standards

**UI Layout & Components** - Document bloco profiles, event cards, user dashboards, and map interfaces

## **Phase 4: Launch Preparation (Week 4+)**

**SEO Strategy** - Since SEO is KEY for your project, document carnival-specific keywords, content optimization, and discoverability tactics[3]

**Testing Strategy** - Plan testing for location features, real-time updates, and multi-language functionality

**Deployment Plan** - Address mobile app deployment, web optimization, and carnival season scaling

## **Carnival-Specific Additions**

Consider adding these specialized documents:

- **Content Moderation Guidelines** - For user-generated bloco content and social interactions
- **Localization Strategy** - Beyond translation, consider regional carnival variations across Brazil
- **Performance Optimization** - For handling carnival season traffic spikes and real-time features
- **Privacy & Location Policy** - Critical for real-time location sharing features

## **Strategic Reasoning**

Your platform combines complex real-time features with content management, social networking, and location services. Starting with PRD and tech stack ensures your LLM assistant understands the carnival domain and technical complexity[1]. The schema design is particularly crucial given your multiple data relationships (users, blocos, events, locations, social connections).

The prioritization follows the principle that documentation should support immediate development needs while building toward your core differentiators: comprehensive bloco information and social carnival experiences[4].
